# Tools that request additional client input

Under MCP `2026-07-28`, a callable tool can return `input_required` instead of a completed result. The client gathers input and retries the original tool. Each attempt runs the callback from the beginning; no PHP invocation stays suspended.

The Adapter supports this for direct `tools/call` handlers. It does not implement MRTR for `prompts/get` or `resources/read`.

## Return an explicit result

Create a direct tool with `McpTool::fromArray()`. The Adapter passes ordinary arguments and a `McpToolCallContext` to its handler. No feature flag is needed. Register the tool through the server's existing `tools` argument.

User-defined callbacks that declare only the arguments parameter can ignore the extra context. Callbacks using a second parameter or variadic arguments now receive context there. Wrap PHP built-in functions in a user-defined callback rather than registering them directly if their signatures do not accept this contract. Calling `McpTool::execute()` outside the Adapter without a context supplies `null` as the second argument.

Return `new McpInputRequired($input_requests, $request_state)` when more input is needed. Input requests are a map of MCP requests keyed by author-chosen identifiers. The optional state is an opaque string owned by the author. The Adapter sends it unchanged. At least one input request or non-null state must be supplied.

Only this explicit object requests another round. Arrays, including arrays with keys named `resultType`, `inputRequests`, or `requestState`, remain ordinary tool data. Normal values and `WP_Error` follow the existing result handling.

| Context method | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `revision()` | The selected MCP revision. |
| `client_capabilities()` | Capabilities declared for this request. |
| `client_supports_elicitation( $mode = 'form' )` | Whether this call can request `'form'` or `'url'` elicitation. Checks the Adapter's supported MRTR revision and the client's declaration; returns `false` for other modes. |
| `input_responses()` | A defensive copy of this request's schema-valid response map. No history is accumulated. |
| `request_state()` | The untrusted, opaque string supplied by the client, or `null`. |
| `is_continuation()` | The client supplied continuation fields. This does not prove a previous interaction. |

Schema-valid responses have valid protocol structure. The Adapter does not check that their values answer the questions you issued, authenticate state, or prove that a human approved anything.

## Confirm post creation before calling an Ability

> **Example scope:** This is one way to wrap an Ability with confirmation. The Adapter provides and validates the MCP interaction. Your application chooses the identity, state storage, expiry, cleanup, recovery, and idempotency mechanisms. Adapt the example to those choices.

Assume your plugin already registers `my-plugin/create-post`. It accepts `title` and `content`, creates a draft, and returns its normal result. Substitute your existing Ability name and input fields; its definition is not repeated here.

The tool below asks **“Allow post creation?”** and only calls the Ability after a validated affirmative answer. Register the returned tool through your server's `tools` argument. The Adapter validates returned protocol values and capabilities. Because this example saves state before returning, it also checks support before that write. Unsupported clients receive an error without creating an approval row.

The factory accepts a callback that returns the current request's **verified client identifier**, supplied by your authentication integration. Do not derive it from tool arguments or `clientInfo.name`. This keeps the example independent of whether your transport uses OAuth, application passwords, or another scheme.

```

Call `$make_create_post_tool($authenticated_client_id)` with your integration's identity callback. The factory returns an `McpTool` or `WP_Error`; check the result before registering it. The example deliberately does not redefine the Ability or implement an authentication system.

## What state and validation do here

`requestState` contains only a random approval ID. The associated record stays in WordPress and contains a digest of the exact proposed title/content, caller identity, tool name, and expiry. Changing the content, switching users or clients, or submitting an unknown or expired ID fails before the Ability runs. The client cannot change the stored record by editing the ID.

The callback validates three different things: original post arguments, the approval's identity and operation binding, and the answer's exact boolean value. The strings `"true"` and `"false"` are not accepted as booleans. `accept` alone is insufficient: `allow` must be `true`. A missing answer repeats the same question with the same state; decline, cancellation, and `allow: false` do not create a post.

The tool's permission callback validates input and delegates to the Ability's own permission callback on every attempt, before showing a question or consuming an approval. A denied retry leaves the pending approval available until expiry. The final `$ability->execute()` still performs the Ability's own input validation, permission checks, execution, and output validation. This is confirmation reported by the MCP client, not independent proof that a human approved the request. Use a separately authenticated approval page if your application requires that stronger guarantee.

The example deletes the stored approval before calling the Ability and proceeds only if deletion succeeds. Concurrent retries cannot both execute with the same approval. The approval remains consumed even if execution fails. This limits execution to at most once per approval; a new approval can still create another post.

A retry after completed execution returns `approval_unavailable` instead of the previous result. A competing request that reaches deletion after another request consumed the approval returns `approval_used`. Neither error proves that the post was not created. After a lost response or an error after consumption, establish the operation's outcome before requesting a new approval.

The [MCP transport changes](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) require clients to reissue requests after a broken response stream, but do not require servers to replay completed results. If your application needs retries to return the earlier result, use an operation-idempotency mechanism that preserves exclusive execution and defines recovery after failures. Saving a result after execution alone leaves a crash window between the operation succeeding and its result being stored. These guarantees belong to your application's workflow, beyond this example's single-use approval.

For brevity, this uses non-autoloaded options. Add cleanup for abandoned/expired records in your plugin, or use your existing workflow store with an atomic consume operation. Options do not expire automatically. The ten-minute lifetime is an example chosen by the tool author, not an Adapter default. This store must be private to your plugin and trusted server code.

## Use the same pattern for post updates

For an existing `my-plugin/update-post` Ability, adapt the wrapper as follows:

- Add a required integer `post_id` to the tool schema and validate it as a positive integer. Include it in the fixed-order `$input` array and therefore its digest.
- Name the tool `update-post-with-confirmation` and use that name in its state binding. Resolve the update Ability instead of the create Ability.
- Require `current_user_can( 'edit_post', $post_id )` for that post before showing its content on every attempt. Pass the final inputs through the Ability executor.
- Ask **“Allow post update?”**, showing the post ID and proposed changes. Use `allow_post_update` as the input-request/response key and the label **“Allow post update”** for the same strict boolean field.
- If approval depends on the previous post contents, save a digest of those contents in the pending record and compare it with the current post on retry. Reject a stale approval instead of overwriting intervening edits. If concurrent updates must be excluded, enforce that condition atomically in the update operation; a preliminary comparison alone is not a lock.

`McpTool::fromAbility()` remains available for ordinary non-interactive exposure. These confirmation wrappers use `McpTool::fromArray()` so state and answers stay outside the Ability's domain inputs.

## State and validation belong to the author

Use your existing workflow store or a protected token when correlation matters. The Adapter does not prescribe storage, token encoding, expiry, replay handling, or a signing key. It does not parse or verify `requestState`.

Treat both state and answers as attacker-controlled input. Before using state to influence authorization, resource access, or business logic, verify its integrity and its association with the authenticated principal and intended operation. Bind elicitation to the authenticated client and user, not unverified client metadata or a claimed user ID in an answer. A database identifier must resolve only to records the authenticated caller may use. A client-carried state payload needs integrity protection such as HMAC or AEAD; signing alone does not hide it.

Choose an appropriate expiry and enforce any at-most-once execution requirement server-side. Decide separately whether a retry after execution receives an error or a stored result; single-use approval does not provide result replay.

Validate answer types and values against the issued question and your domain rules. Protocol schema validation does not enforce a form's `requestedSchema` against its submitted content. Use your existing validation code or the Ability's input validation when those express the same constraints. Do not assume WordPress REST validation enforces strict JSON types without coercion.

An `accept` answer is not independently verified human approval. In URL mode it indicates consent to open the URL, not completion of the external operation. Verify completion through your own server-side state. Never collect secrets through form elicitation; use the protocol's URL flow and verify identity there.

See the [MRTR requirements](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/patterns/mrtr) and [elicitation requirements](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/client/elicitation) for the server obligations an author must implement.

## What the Adapter enforces

The Adapter validates outgoing and incoming protocol structures through the exact schema. It checks the client's elicitation capability and mode before sending an elicitation request. Unsupported capabilities return `-32021` with HTTP 400. Sampling and roots input requests are not supported and return an internal error. A form's `requestedSchema` must declare `type: object` and `properties`; an input request that fails schema validation is logged and returned as `-32603`, never sent to the client. These checks happen after the callback returns; they cannot undo its side effects. A callback that persists state before returning an input request must check the revision and necessary capabilities before that write, as the example does. Tool permission callbacks run on every attempt.

Continuation fields on Ability-backed tools, other supported methods without an MRTR implementation, or the 2025 revision are rejected. A direct tool may complete normally under `2025-11-25`, but returning `McpInputRequired` produces an explicit internal error (`-32603`). The Adapter never silently downgrades it to completed output.

The `mcp_adapter_tool_call_result` filter receives the `McpInputRequired` object unchanged. Filters that reshape array results must pass it through.
