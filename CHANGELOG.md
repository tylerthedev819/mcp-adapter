# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/), and will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-23

### Breaking Changes
- Schema-backed MCP revisions are exactly `2025-11-25` and `2026-07-28`. `2025-06-18` and `2024-11-05` no longer have their own DTOs; they are negotiated as legacy identifiers and served through the `2025-11-25` schema (see Added). `McpVersionNegotiator::SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` now lists only the schema-backed revisions; legacy identifiers moved to `McpVersionNegotiator::LEGACY_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS`.
- Protocol-facing server getters `get_tools()`, `get_resources()`, `get_prompts()`, and `get_prompt()` require a selected `Schema`. There is no implicit default revision.
- The generated DTO classes, `get_protocol_dto()`, and the alternate array serializers have been replaced by exact-revision schema records from `wordpress/php-mcp-schema`. See the [dual-revision migration guide](docs/migration/v0.7.0.md#migrating-to-the-dual-revision-schema-runtime).
- `McpToolValidator`, `McpResourceValidator`, `McpPromptValidator`, `McpErrorFactory::validate_jsonrpc_message()`, `McpServer::is_mcp_validation_enabled()`, and the `mcp_adapter_validation_enabled` filter have been removed. Wire validation always runs through the selected schema.
- `RequestRouter::route_request()`, method handlers, `McpErrorFactory`, `ContentBlockHelper`, and `McpPromptBuilderInterface::build()` now exchange schema records and revision-neutral arrays instead of DTOs. `JsonRpcResponseBuilder` has been removed. Custom transports must delegate to `HttpRequestHandler` or `McpWireOrchestrator`.
- `McpTool::fromArray()`, `McpResource::fromArray()`, and `McpPrompt::fromArray()` return `WP_Error` only for structural problems (missing name, URI, or handler; invalid resource URI). Schema and annotation problems no longer fail construction; they are reported per revision through `is_available_for()` and `get_projection_error()` and logged as warnings at registration.
- The non-canonical `tools/list/all` method and `ToolsHandler::list_all_tools()` have been removed.
- JSON-RPC batch requests are rejected before dispatch.
- `wp mcp-adapter list` adds per-revision tool, resource, and prompt columns.
- `WP\MCP\Cli` classes are `final` and can no longer be extended ([#306](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/306)).

- Invalid protocol fields are no longer silently dropped or repaired. Components invalid in every supported schema revision are rejected. Handler values reach final schema projection. In 2026 responses, result `_meta` is validated before server identification is added, so malformed metadata is rejected and valid object fields are preserved. This reverses the 0.6.0 omission of malformed `_meta`. See the [validation migration notes](docs/migration/v0.7.0.md#validation-and-rejected-components).
- Removed validation and content helpers and the resource/prompt converter `make()` and getter layers are listed in the [migration guide](docs/migration/v0.7.0.md#removed-helpers-and-converter-methods).
- Non-array Ability `meta.mcp` now returns `mcp_ability_invalid_meta`. Removed errors: `mcp_resource_missing_name`, `mcp_prompt_invalid_argument`, and `mcp_prompt_argument_missing_name`. Non-array prompt arguments return `mcp_prompt_invalid_arguments`; resource-name filters reject non-strings only.

### Added
- Legacy MCP identifiers `2025-06-18` and `2024-11-05` negotiate through `initialize` and are echoed back verbatim while the `2025-11-25` schema serves the session. Every server-emitted difference between those revisions and `2025-11-25` is an optional additive field, so the projection is unchanged. `MCP-Protocol-Version` must match the negotiated identifier when sent, and may be omitted only for sessions negotiated under `2024-11-05`, which predates the header. `2025-03-26` stays non-negotiable because it requires servers to receive JSON-RPC batches; a proposal receives `2025-11-25` as before. `server/discover` and the unsupported-version error list the same two schema-backed revisions.
- `McpRequestContext::protocol_version()` returns the negotiated identifier; `revision()` continues to return the schema revision.
- MCP `2026-07-28` support: the sessionless `server/discover` lifecycle, per-request protocol metadata in the request body, and the `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name`, and `Mcp-Param-*` headers over HTTP. STDIO accepts either revision per line.
- `McpRequestContext`, an immutable per-request context carrying the selected schema, transport, and session data.
- `McpWireOrchestrator` and `JsonRpcRequestDecoder`, one decode, validate, dispatch, and encode boundary shared by the HTTP and STDIO transports.
- `McpTool`, `McpResource`, and `McpPrompt` expose `get_protocol_record( Schema $schema )` and `is_available_for()`. A component is omitted from a revision whose schema cannot represent it.
- The `mcp_adapter_tools_list`, `mcp_adapter_resources_list`, `mcp_adapter_prompts_list`, and `mcp_adapter_initialize_response` filters receive the selected schema as a third argument.
- Raw-wire, architecture, and projection test coverage for both revisions.
- Components rejected by every supported schema revision raise `_doing_it_wrong` with schema error paths, in addition to error-handler logs.
- Direct callable tools can return `McpInputRequired` under MCP `2026-07-28` to request elicitation input, and receive the client's answers through `McpToolCallContext` on retry ([#316](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/316)).

### Changed
- Request observability status and duration include final response projection, and `server/discover` emits a completion event. Invalid handler results return `-32603`, `Internal error: The server produced an invalid result.`, with one failed request event and a correlated diagnostic through the configured error handler. See the [observability migration notes](docs/migration/v0.7.0.md#request-observability).
- Resource abilities support core's top-level `meta.annotations` without a deprecation notice. `meta.mcp.annotations` overrides it, and an empty array suppresses annotations instead of falling back.
- Ability labels and descriptions preserve whitespace, and tool `title` is always emitted from the label. Resource names may be empty; absent names use the URI.
- Resource URIs are no longer trimmed or limited to 2048 bytes; bare schemes such as `wordpress:` are accepted. Invalid `lastModified` timestamps reject resources on both registration paths.
- Prompt results preserve supplied descriptions, metadata, message keys, and empty message lists. Malformed recognized shapes reach schema validation; JSON fallback encoding failures return execution errors.
- Direct tool factories default `inputSchema` only when absent. Prompt fallback arguments include boolean property schemas and preserve supplied titles and descriptions.
- Usage of MCP Adapter as a bundled library has been deprecated in favor of using the canonical MCP Adapter plugin. See the [v0.7.0 migration guide](docs/migration/v0.7.0.md) for instructions on how to migrate away from a bundled copy of MCP Adapter.
- `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, and `ping` are served only for `2025-11-25`; `server/discover` only for `2026-07-28`. The 2025 HTTP session lifecycle is unchanged.
- Adapter-owned `2026-07-28` output omits `Tool.execution`, adds `resultType: "complete"` to completed results, and adds `ttlMs: 0` and `cacheScope: "private"` to discovery, list, and resource-read results.
- Missing tools and prompts return Invalid Params (`-32602`) in both revisions. Missing resources return `-32002` in `2025-11-25` and `-32602` in `2026-07-28`. An unsupported per-request version returns `-32022`.
- Session validation errors carry the JSON-RPC request ID of the failing request instead of `null`.
- `tools/call` and `resources/read` look up the tool name and resource URI exactly as sent. Surrounding whitespace is no longer trimmed, so a padded name cannot bypass the `2026-07-28` `Mcp-Param-*` header check.
- `resources/read` forwards only the protocol-defined parameters (`uri`, `_meta`, `inputResponses`, `requestState`) to permission callbacks, the `mcp_adapter_pre_resource_read` filter, and resource handlers. Unknown request keys are dropped.
- `2025-11-25` `tools/call` responses omit `structuredContent` when a tool returns a JSON list, because that schema types the field as an object. The text block still carries the encoded list. `2026-07-28` responses keep the list.

### Fixed
- Default abilities register when another plugin initializes the Abilities API before the MCP server initializes.
- `mcp-adapter/get-ability-info` serializes an empty `input_schema` as `{}` instead of `[]`.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- The release ZIP no longer ships a Jetpack Autoloader class map pointing at files the ZIP omits. In 0.6.0 the class map listed test-only global classes, including `WP_CLI` and `WP_CLI_Command`, and mapped them to files under `tests/phpunit/`, which the release artifact excludes. Any plugin calling `class_exists( 'WP_CLI' )` on a normal web request could therefore trigger an uncaught fatal error. `class_exists( 'WP_CLI' )` now returns `false` when WP-CLI is unavailable ([#283](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/issues/283)).

No API, hook, or protocol behavior changed. Upgrading from 0.6.0 requires no migration. Installations built from source or required through Composer were unaffected.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-12

### Breaking Changes
- WordPress 6.9 or newer is now required. The standalone Abilities API plugin is no longer a supported installation path.
- Abilities with `meta.public: true` are now exposed through the default MCP server unless `meta.mcp.public` explicitly opts out. Existing permission callbacks and capability checks still apply.
- On multisite only, active Streamable HTTP sessions must reconnect once after upgrading, because session storage moves from a network-wide key to separate per-site keys. Single-site installations are unaffected.
- The MIME validation helpers previously exposed by `McpValidator` have been removed. Integrations calling them directly should apply their own application-specific MIME validation.

### Added
- Support for `resources/templates/list`, returning an empty template list when no templates are available.
- Blocked direct execution of plugin PHP files.
- Expanded automated compatibility, dependency, and Plugin Check coverage.

### Changed
- Jetpack Autoloader is now used so the newest available `WP\MCP` classes win when the standalone adapter and another plugin bundle different versions.
- Session storage is scoped by blog on WordPress multisite.
- Concurrent session mutations are protected with bounded retries, reducing the risk of one request overwriting another session.
- Documentation clarifies that the Abilities API is included in WordPress 6.9 and newer, documents the required ability `category` field, and improves examples throughout.

### Fixed
- `_meta` is preserved on resource contents, embedded resources, content blocks, and prompt messages.
- Malformed `_meta` is omitted without discarding the payload it accompanies.
- `mimeType` is emitted exactly as declared, including values with parameters such as `text/html;profile=mcp-app`.
- Blob-only resource contents are handled correctly.
- Resource URI schemes are matched case-insensitively, so clients can read resources even when they normalize the scheme to lowercase.
- Empty arguments are normalized for schema-defining abilities, allowing valid zero-argument tool calls to execute.
- `wp mcp-adapter serve` keeps JSON-RPC stdout clean when selecting the default server.
- WP-CLI's global `--user` argument is used instead of registering a conflicting local option.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Full integration of [`wordpress/php-mcp-schema`](https://github.com/WordPress/php-mcp-schema) throughout the adapter, so MCP responses use typed protocol DTOs instead of hand-built arrays.
- Typed DTO handling for MCP tools, resources, prompts, initialization, and JSON-RPC errors.
- Protocol version negotiation for `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18`, and `2024-11-05`.

### Changed
- Validation, encapsulation, and type-safety improvements across the core and domain layers.
- Security hardening with stricter input validation and fail-closed permission handling.
- Reduced `SessionManager` write amplification to lower lock contention.
- Packaging and dependency updates, including the `php-mcp-schema` v0.1.1 follow-up for cleaner Composer dist archives.
- Improved observability for protocol errors and `isError` tool responses.

Existing ability registration, `create_server()`, and WordPress hooks are unchanged. Custom handlers, transports, or code depending on internal component structures should review the [v0.5.0 migration guide](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/blob/trunk/docs/migration/v0.5.0.md).

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed
- Corrected JSON-RPC error response structure and HTTP status codes ([#106](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/106)).
- Error messages are now returned properly when using unnested error formats in `ToolsHandler` ([#90](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/90)).

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- Automatic transformation of flattened schemas (string, number, boolean, array) into MCP-compatible object schemas, so abilities using flattened schemas now work. The MCP specification requires all tool input schemas to be of type `object` ([#93](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/93)).
- `.gitattributes` to exclude development files from releases ([#94](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/94)).
- GNU General Public License v2 ([#97](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/97)).

### Changed
- Applied WordPress PHP documentation standards ([#92](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/92)).

### Fixed
- Annotation field name mismatches between the Abilities API format and the MCP specification. `readonly` now maps to `readOnlyHint`, `destructive` to `destructiveHint`, and `idempotent` to `idempotentHint` ([#91](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/91)).
- Missing comma in the transport permissions example ([#85](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/85)).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-06

### Breaking Changes
- `RestTransport` and `StreamableTransport` have been removed and replaced by the unified `HttpTransport` class ([#48](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/48)).
- Observability events now use unified names with a `status` tag instead of separate success and failure event names.
- Observability handlers now use instance methods instead of static methods, and `McpObservabilityHelperTrait::record_error_event()` has been removed.
- All filter and action names now use the `mcp_adapter_` prefix ([#81](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/81)).

### Added
- Unified `HttpTransport` with session management, streaming support, and enhanced error handling ([#48](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/48)).
- Metadata-driven observability, recorded centrally at the transport layer with automatic metadata extraction from handler responses.

### Changed
- Error handling refactored to use the `WP_Error` pattern throughout, replacing exceptions ([#71](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/71)).

### Fixed
- Tool error handling now complies with the MCP specification ([#73](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/73)).
- Metadata no longer leaks into tool response content ([#72](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/72)).
- `WP_Error` handling in `PromptsHandler` and `ResourcesHandler` ([#74](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/74)).
- Null parameter handling in Prompts and Resources handlers ([#77](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/77)).
- Parameter handling for abilities without input schemas ([#76](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/76)).
- Prompt parameter validation, by converting `input_schema` to MCP arguments ([#78](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/78)).
- The `init` action now fires before initializing in WP-CLI ([#86](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/pull/86)).

See the [v0.3.0 migration guide](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/blob/trunk/docs/migration/v0.3.0.md) for detailed upgrade instructions.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-14

### Added
- First stable release: ability-to-MCP conversion, multi-server management, extensible transport layer, error handling, observability, validation, and granular permission control.
